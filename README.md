# OVERVIEW:
Telecommunication is all about connecting people through calls, messages, and internet services. In this project, we're diving into the world of call data analysis. Imagine understanding how many calls people make, how long they talk, and where these calls happen. It's like peeking behind the scenes of our phone networks.
 A Call center is a department primarily assigned to provide customer support, resolve problems, attend to inquiries, and offer product/service information.  They handle incoming and outgoing telephone calls from both old and new customers.
# BUSINESS PROBLEM: 
Keeping track of events like the number of calls, callers, and location has been of hindrance to our stakeholders and the company at large. As a result of that, we seek data visualization to draw insights and record visible growth.
#### 1.	Communication Channels:
The company has four *(4)* communication channels all which are accessible to the public;

 •	Call-center
 
 •	Chatbot

#### Task for communication channels

--Find the communication channel that is mostly used and very effective.

#### 2.	Response Time:
The team intends to keep track of time spent on calls at different locations and times. This will also help during employment and approval of new staff.

###### Task

# Data Collection and Cleaning:
 The datasets were obtained from Her Data Project as a CSV file, now hosted on Excel. I went ahead and duplicated the table in other to maintain originality, confirmed their data types, validated my dataset, and inserted a new sheet where I placed my pivot table.

# Descriptive Analysis: 
This is an interactive dashboard analysis with a slicer used to report connectivity. Using a pivot table, a comparison was done and It was discovered that there were more negative sentiments than very positive ones and that while there were different reasons for calls, customers complained about billing questions. Using metrics, I divided the total number of calls by the total of channels being used. Call-center had the highest usage of 32% amidst other communication channels, this was represented with a doughnut chart. Response time rate seemed to be poor above the SLA, this was represented with a bar chart. Washington City received the highest number of calls throughout the month, the total number of received calls was recorded at 32,941.

# Insights:
During the analysis, it was discovered that call center channel is easily access and most used by the clients. A total of 10,639 calls was recorded via this channel, followed by chatbot with a total number of 8256 calls. It was also denoted that client had issues navigating the billing questions hence the high rate of negative sentiment across globe. Denver/CO is the call center with the lowest number of calls per day, this is quite of a concern as there could be different reasons for this. Response time tend to be low below and above SLA with Los Angeles receiving the highest call complaints.

# Recommendations:
Stakeholders are advised to create awareness and host bootcamps to aid clients know of other channels of communication so as not to saturate the call center, as well as making accessibility to other channels easier.
Billing questions should be simplified and worked on to avoid series of negative complaints.
Publicity of call centers like Denver/CO should be taken seriously as this will aid boost the number of calls across board.
